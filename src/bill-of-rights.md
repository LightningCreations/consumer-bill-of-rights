# Consumer Bill of Rights

## Right to Product/Service that is Useful and Functional By Design

Every Product and Service must have a purpose, and every Consumer of that Product or Service shall have a right to a Product or Service which is useful and that carries out the purpose of the product or service. 
Further every Consumer has a right to accurate advertising about the purpose of a Product or Service and any known issues that impact its functionality.

### Right to Reasonable Continuity

Where a Product is offered for sale, Consumers have a right to have that product continue to operate regardless of any future decision to discontinue it. This includes any service that is offered to provide the core functionality of that product.

Where a Service is offered for sale on a perpetual basis, or otherwise for a one-time fee, Consumers have a right to have that service continue to operate regardless of any future decision to discontinue it. This may include retaining the service in maintenance-only mode, or providing Consumers the ability to use a 3rd party service that provides the functionality.

The Right to Reasonable Continuity also implies that products are not designed to fail within a reasonable lifetime.

### Right to Repair

Consumers have a right to repairable products, in the event a product has failed (either due to damage, due to defects, or due to wear and tear from use). Consumers have a right to documentation about a product that enables them or a 3rd party to repair damage to it. 
Additionally, Consumers have a right not to have any undue burdens - including legal burdens - placed upon them in repairing a product, or having a 3rd party repair the product. This includes deliberately designing a product that is difficult to repair, but doesn't include choices made for a legitimate functionality reasons that impact repairability.


### Right to Reasonable Functionality

Every Product must reasonably be functional in its own right, and not require use of unreasonable subscriptions to perform its core functionality - including any functionality that is advertised without clear marking otherwise. Requiring a separate subscription for core functionality may be reasonable if providing that functionality to the consumer requires an ongoing expense on behalf of the business.
