# Consumer Bill of Rights

## Definitions

A Consumer is any person that enters into a transaction for products or services with a business, called a Provider.

A Provider is an entity that produces products or services for consumers. 

A Product is a tangible asset or physical property, or intellectual property offered on a perpetual basis or license, that is sold or offered for sale on a mass market basis, and may include a combination of the above.

A Service is an intangible asset or provision that is offered, whether or not for a fee, on a mass market basis, typically on a non-perpetual or reccuring basis.

A Subscription Service is a service that is offered for a fee that is typically paid on a recurring basis.

## Useful and Functional By Design

Every Product and Service must have a purpose, and every Consumer of that Product or Service shall have a right to a Product or Service which is useful and that carries out the purpose of the product or service. 
Further every Consumer has a right to accurate advertising about the purpose of a Product or Service and any known issues that impact its functionality.
