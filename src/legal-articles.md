* The Agreement is a Unilateral Agreement for exchanging goods or limited-time services for capital,
* The Agreement is non-negotiated, and
* The Agreement contains no terms not necessary to effectuate the transaction, and does not contain a prohibited provision.

The Corporation shall not amend the Enforcement Provisions applied to any given agreement except as necessary to enforce updates to the Bill of Rights.

## Prohibited Provisions

The Corporation shall not, in entering into any agreement with a Consumer for goods or services, without express request and negotiation of the Consumer, include any of the following provisions:
* A Provision requiring the Consumer to pursue claims under the agreement through Arbitration, rather than a Court of Law,
* A Provision requiring the Consumer to waive the right to pursue claims under the agreement as a Class of similarly situated Consumers,
* If the good or service is offered for a fee, a provision waiving or disclaiming the implied warranties in respect to the good or service unless the agreement offers an explicit warranty instead,


The Corporation shall not require a consumer to assent to the above provisions as a condition of the Corporation offering the agreement, nor shall the Corporation provide preferential or beneficial terms or consideration in exchange for a consumer assenting to the above provisions.
