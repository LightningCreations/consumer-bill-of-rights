# Consumer Bill of Rights: Overview

## What is this Document?

This is the Lightning Creations Consumer Bill of Rights, which is a document that prescribes a series of rights that you (as a consumer) are owed by businesses who sell you products and services.

Compliance with this document is (unfortunately) voluntary on the part of the Business, but may be opted-into in a legally binding way (see below, if you are a business owner interested in opting-in and promoting consumer rights).

This document is supplemental to Consumer Rights Legislation - it applies on top of, not instead of, your local laws protecting Consumer Rights.
