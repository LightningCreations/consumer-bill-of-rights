# Consumer Bill of Rights: Overview

## What is this Document?

This is the Lightning Creations Consumer Bill of Rights, which is a document that prescribes a series of rights that you (as a consumer) are owed by businesses who sell you products and services.

Compliance with this document is (unfortunately) voluntary on the part of the Business, but may be opted-into in a legally binding way (see below, if you are a business owner interested in opting-in and promoting consumer rights).

This document is supplemental to Consumer Rights Legislation - it applies on top of, not instead of, your local laws protecting Consumer Rights.

## Why does this document exist?

## Who uses this document?

Lightning Creations itself uses it. A more comprehensive list may appear later.

## Can I apply this document to my own company?

Yes, yes you can!

## ... _How_ can I apply this document to my own company?

There are two main ways to apply this document, which can be used together:

* Assuming your company is a Corporation (including an LLC or LLP), you can incorporate the [Legal Provisions (Incorporating/Controlling Documents)](legal-articles.md) (either by copy or by reference) in your Incorporating Document (usually called the Articles of Incorporation or Articles of Organization) or Controlling Document (usually called By-Laws or Operating Agreement), which allows your members or shareholders (whichever applies) to enforce the terms against the Corporation,
* When you sell a product or service to a consumer (or even offer a service for free), you might have an explicit contract between you and the consumer (for services or software licenses, may be called the Terms of Service or End User License Agreement/EULA). You can incorporate the [Legal Provisions (Terms of Service)](legal-terms.md) (by copy or by reference) into that contract, which allows that particular consumer to enforce the terms against the Corporation.

We are also working on a possible third option, that includes making it easy for you to advertise to consumers that you comply with this document

Of course, you can also just adopt the document informally, but we recommend applying at least one of the options above.
